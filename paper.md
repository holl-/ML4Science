# Summary

UnifyML is a Python library...

# Introduction

Motivation

Python 3 [@Python3]

Unify ML frameworks (Like eagerpy [@rauber2020eagerpy]) but 
* named+typed dimensions (no shape errors)
* unified device handling
* unified precision handling, automatic casts (no dtype errors)

Used by PhiFlow [@phiflow] for incompressible fluid, KS, many more
